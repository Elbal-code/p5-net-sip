PrioA:
* document dns_host2ip and dns_domain2srv in Net::SIP::Dispatcher
  and make it truly asnychronous
* document exports from Net::SIP
* document Net::SIP::NATHelper

-----

- more examples
  * simple proxy + registrar
  * NAT proxy

- more tests
  * invite + listen using proxy + registrar
  * calls involving transfer of RTP data
  * use sdp_on_ack, asymetric_rtp in tests
  * tests using re-invites (from UAC and from UAS)
  * tests, where either the UAC or the UAS issues a BYE
  * tests with bad relay in between, which forgets
    packets, so that retransmits will be tested
  * proxy with NAT where SDP data come in
     * 18x + 2xx + INVITE
     * 2xx + ACK
  * tests for delivering packets using Net::SIP::Dispatcher:resolve_uri
  * tests for forwarding packets in stateless proxy 
    based on route, via, uri,...
  * tests for the examples, especially samples/stateless_proxy.pl

- more documentation
  * describe mechanism to use another Leg implementation
  * samples for integration with other loops

- implementation
  * better async handling of DNS SRV in Net::SIP::Dispatcher::resolve_uri
  * full support for TCP
  * maybe add Contact header by default for Endpoint?
