- do not reply to invalid messages.
  This is contrary to RFC, but helps against DDOS attacks
  caused by spoofed UDP packets
- SIP security is like SMTP, e.g.
  * depends heavily on DNS (which could be spoofed)
  * no end-to-end encryption of SIP, e.g.
    encryption needs to be inside RTP and need to be
    set up end-to-end (like with ZRTP, unlike SRTP)
    Traffic control data can be intercepted by rough proxy
    in chain!
- it's udp, so it easy to spoof
- endpoint usually simple and buggy, need to be protected, e.g
  should maybe rewrite complete message while forwarding
  so that it's definitly correctly formatted

special:
- SIP header is UTF-8, should be checked for invalid UTF-8 char
- escaping % 
- method names in request and cseq are case sensitive
- cseq id musted be 32bit unsigned
