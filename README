This is a module for handling SIP, the IETF standard for VOIP
(RFC3289).
It is written completly in perl.

With the help of this module you can write SIP endpoints (e.g
phones, answer machines), SIP proxies and registrars.
It contains no GUI and no real code for working with video or
audio, but is has some support for RTP (no RTCP) and working
with PCMU/8000 data, enough for sending PCMU/8000 encoded
audio to a SIP peer and for receiving and saving PCMU/8000
audio data. 
See samples directory for projects like a simple answer machine.

The module is designed to be completly asynchronous, e.g. you
either integrate it in your own event handling or you can use 
the simple event handling which is included.

It was tested on OpenBSD 3.9, Linux (Ubuntu 6.10) and 
MacOSX 10. with various perl versions starting with perl5.8.7.
